# Releasenotes Threefold chain v1.0.6

## Upgrade concerns

-   the `--legacy` and `--locktime` flags have been removed from the wallet send commands as well as the fact that the REST `POST /wallet/coin` and `POST /wallet/blockstakes` no longer take a version as argument. If your technology does still give a version argument, not to worry, it will simply be ignored, and `version: 1` will be used instead, as should have been your choice already anyhow.
