# tfchain

tfchain is the official Go implementation of the ThreeFold blockchain client. It uses and is build on top of the [Rivine][rivine] protocol.

The ThreeFold blockchain is used as a ledger for the ThreeFold Token ("TFT"), a digital currency backed by neutral and sustainable internet capacity. You can learn more about the ThreeFold token on [threefoldtoken.com](https://threefoldtoken.com).

The ThreeFold blockchain is the technology behind the ThreeFold Grid ("TF Grid" or "Grid"), a grid where your data is local and controlled by you, shaping a new neutral and sustainable Internet. To learn more about this grid you can find and read the whitepaper at [threefoldtoken.com/pdf/tf_whitepaper.pdf](https://threefoldtoken.com/pdf/tf_whitepaper.pdf).

## install and use tfchain

You have 2 easy options to install tfchain in your work environment, as a prequisite to using the tfchain binaries and thus become a full tfchain node. Currently there is only a test network.

### tfchain docker container

The easiest is pulling and using the latest prebuilt docker container:

```
$ docker pull tfchain/tfchain
$ docker run -d --name tfchain tfchain/tfchain
```

This will pull and configure the latest tfchain container, and it will start a container using that image in the program, named `tfchaind`.

Should you want to use to use the CLI client, you can do so doing the running container:

```
$ docker exec -ti tfchain /tfchainc 
```

Note that this minimal tfchain docker container is not really meant to be used for much tfchain CLI client interaction. If you wish to do a lot of that, it is probably more easy/useful to run a the tfchain binary CLI from your host machine. If you are interested in that, you can check out [the "tfchain from source" section](#tfchain-from-source).

Even though the image for these containers is prebuilt available for you, should you wish to use a tfchain docker container from the hacked source code you can rebuilt those imagines using `docker-minimal`.

### tfchain from source

tfchain is developed and implemented using [Golang](http://golang.org). Using the golang toolchain it is very easy to download, update and install the tfchain binaries used to run a full node and interact with it:

```
$ go get -u github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/cmd/... && \
    tfchaind &
```

> tfchain supports Go 1.8 and above. Older versions of Golang may work but aren't supported.

At this point (if all went right) you should have a tfchain daemon running in the background which is syncing with the test net. You can follow this syncing process using the CLI client: `tfchainc`.

Should you want to learn more, you can find additional daemon documentation of the daemon at [/doc/tfchaind.md](/doc/tfchaind.md) and the (CLI) client on [doc/tfchainc.md](doc/tfchainc.md).

## standard (net)

By default a tfchain daemon (`tfchaind`) will connect to the standard net(work).

This is the official network for ThreeFoldTokens.
You can learn more about the ThreeFold token on [threefoldtoken.com](https://threefoldtoken.com).

The standard net has following properties:

+ A new block every 2 minutes (on average);
+ Block stakes can be used 1 day after receiving;
+ One TFT equals to 10<sup>9</sup> of the smallest currency unit;
+ Payouts take roughly one day to mature;

All properties can be found in: [/cmd/tfchaind/main.go](/cmd/tfchaind/main.go) (in the `getStandardnetGenesis` function body).

The standard (net) uses the following bootstrap nodes:

+ bootstrap1.threefoldtoken.com:23112
+ bootstrap2.threefoldtoken.com:23112
+ bootstrap3.threefoldtoken.com:23112
+ bootstrap4.threefoldtoken.com:23112

A web-ui explorer for the standard (net) is available at https://explorer.threefoldtoken.com.

## devnet

// TODO

## testnet

Currently there is no testnet available. Soon it will be back.

## technical information

tfchain is using and build on top of [Rivine][rivine], a generic blockchain protocol, using Proof of Blockstake (PoB), rather than the also popular Proof of Work (PoW). It allows for custom blockchain implementations, hence tfchain is a custom implementation of the [Rivine][rivine] protocol.

This official (Golang) implementation is build using a vendored version of [the reference Golang implementation of Rivine][rivine].

For in-depth technical information you can check the [Rivine][rivine] docs at [github.com/rivine/rivine/tree/master/doc](https://github.com/rivine/rivine/tree/master/doc). There are no technical docs in this repository, as all the technology lives and is developed within the [Rivine repository][rivine].
