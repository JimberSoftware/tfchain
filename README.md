## testnet

A testnet for the threefold chain is currently deployed, and can be connected to using the binaries provided on the release page.
The testnet parameters are:

    - 10 minute block time
    - 1 million blockstakes created in the genesis block
    - 100 million coins created in the genesis block
    - 10 coins block reward
    - 144 block maturity delay for miner payouts (~ 1 day)

### Receiving tokens for testnet

Currently there is no automated way for receiving tokens on the testnet. [An issue for it has been created](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/tfchain/issues/12), but there is no ETA for an implemented solution.

Should you require X amount of tokens for the testnet, prior to this automated solution being available, you can request them by creating an issue on GitHub where you give your address as well as the amount of tokens you require. The title of your github issue should be in the form of "`Testnet token request for <address>`".

Once we completed that transfer we'll close your issue. Should you require more tokens in the future for the same address, you can simply re-open the issue and request more tokens tat way. Please do not recreate multiple token requests for the same address. Do also not link multiple addresses in a single issue, as that might get confusing.
